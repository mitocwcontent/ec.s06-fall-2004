| 1 | Course Introduction | How to connect the power supply  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}How to read a voltage, resistance, and current with the DMM  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Reading resistors  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}How protoboard is laid out  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Each team builds a voltage divider with nom. 3.3 V output, and measure Vout. However, each team works in different resistance regimes (from 100's of Ohms to 100 kOhm)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Each team puts same set of load resistors on their dividers (100's ohms to MOhm)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}All teams exchange data and plot results from all teams on one graph in their notebooks - discuss loading of dividers! |
| 2 | Resistors and Diodes | LED lamp driver  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Driving multiple LEDs in parallel and series  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Use potentiometer to limit current and map I-V curve, each team with different color LED (one team with silicon signal diode)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}All teams exchange data and plot results from all teams on one graph in their notebooks  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Build and test 7805 circuit w/load |
| 3 | Bridge Circuits | Build bridge rectifier with LEDs and use the load resister to limit current  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}See conduction paths light up depending on polarity of AC input  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Measure voltage drop across load for both polarities  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Measure voltage at each end of load w.r.t. ground of 9V battery for both polarities  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Mechanical switch limits speed, so introduce function generator  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Find maximum frequency that gives no flicker  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Introduce Oscilloscope to view waveforms |
| 4 | Oscilloscopes and Capacitors | Review operation of Oscilloscope  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Add ripple reduction filter on bridge rectifier from last week |
| 5 | Filters | Each team uses unique RC combination for low-pass filter, measures amplitude response at 10-12 frequency  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}All teams exchange data and plot results from all teams on one graph in their notebooks - discuss different turn-on voltages  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Repeat 3) and 4) for high-pass filters |
| 6 | Relays and Transistors | Drive motor off of power supply  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Build relay driver to toggle LED  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Build relay driver to toggle motor  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Build NPN transistor switch driving LED and demonstrate  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Drive transistor-controlled LED with function generator  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Build and demonstrate NPN transistor switch driving motor |
| 7 | Op-Amps | Build x2 gain inverting op-amp with potentiometer-based voltage divider as input. Drive a range of loads, compare results to bare divider  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Give each team a different op-amp circuit to build, measure, and analyze  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Each team presents results and analysis for its circuit to rest of class |
| 8 | 555 Timer Circuit | Build 555 as one-shot driving an LED  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Present internal model and analyze  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Build 555 as oscillator driving an LED |
| 9 | Sensors | Measure resistance of CdS cells under low and high levels of light  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Use results to select a fixed resistor, use that resistor and CdS cell to make voltage divider circuit to detect light  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Use comparator to drive LED  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Voltage divider (potentiometer) as input to comparator-driven LED  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}CdS cell divider as input  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Light-activated motor  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Add RC filter to get transient motor drive when light turns on (or off)
